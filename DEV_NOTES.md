### Testing Notes
- Tested distribution strategy selection with both "roundRobin" and "category_match"
- Verified that the global pause feature correctly prevents new leads from being distributed
- Confirmed that the company UI correctly shows the current settings
- Validated that the reports page correctly aggregates data
- Tested address lookup functionality with Norwegian provider and fallback
- Validated that LeadStatus values are properly checked and fallback to 'new' when invalid
- Validated that parseLead correctly handles valid and invalid status values
- Confirmed that missing fields are handled gracefully with sensible defaults
- Verified that API functions return properly parsed Lead objects
- Tested content management system with all role types
- Verified content editor properly validates input fields
- Confirmed scheduled publishing functionality works correctly

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Add more test coverage for lead distribution functions
- [ ] Create tests for lead status transitions
- [ ] Implement the budget utilization feature
- [ ] Add more detailed filtering options for lead distribution
- [ ] Create better visualization for company performance
- [ ] Add export functionality for lead reports
- [ ] Implement notification system for new leads
- [ ] Add more address lookup providers (SE, DK, etc.)
- [ ] Create similar parsing functions for other entities (CompanyProfile, LeadSettings, etc.)
- [ ] Add content preview feature before publishing
- [ ] Implement rich text editor for content editing
- [ ] Add image upload capability to content module

## Roadmap

### Short-term
1. Complete the budget tracking system
2. Implement lead quality scoring
3. Add more detailed reporting for companies
4. Expand test coverage for critical modules
5. Extend parsing utilities to other entity types
6. Enhance content publishing workflow with approval steps
7. Add media library for content images

### Long-term
1. Implement AI-based lead matching
2. Create a mobile app for companies to manage leads on-the-go
3. Integrate with CRM systems
4. Implement a bidding system for leads
5. Create more advanced content management features like versioning and scheduling

## Type Safety Examples

### Safe Lead Status Handling

When processing leads from the database:

```typescript
// Unsafe approach (don't do this)
const leads = apiData as Lead[]; // Might include invalid status values

// Safe approach (do this)
const leads = apiData.map(item => ({
  ...item,
  status: isValidLeadStatus(item.status) ? item.status : 'new',
})) as Lead[];
```

### Safe Lead Parsing

```typescript
// Previously (unsafe approach - don't do this)
const leads = apiData as Lead[]; // Might cause TS2589 error

// Now (safe approach - do this)
import { parseLead } from '../utils/parseLead';
const leads = (apiData || []).map(parseLead);
```

### Type Guards Usage

```typescript
// Type guard for LeadStatus
function isValidLeadStatus(value: any): value is LeadStatus {
  return LEAD_STATUSES.includes(value);
}

// Example usage
function processLeadStatus(status: unknown) {
  if (isValidLeadStatus(status)) {
    // TypeScript now knows status is LeadStatus
    return `Valid status: ${status}`;
  } else {
    return 'Invalid status';
  }
}
```

### Content Type Guard Example

```typescript
// Type guard for ContentType
function isValidContentType(value: any): value is ContentType {
  return ['article', 'news', 'guide'].includes(value);
}

// Safe parsing with type guard
function parseContent(data: any): Content {
  return {
    ...data,
    type: isValidContentType(data.type) ? data.type : 'article',
  };
}
```

## Testing Examples

### Running Tests
To run tests, you'll need to use Vitest directly:

```bash
npx vitest run
# Or for a specific test file
npx vitest run src/modules/geo/__tests__/addressLookup.test.ts
```

### Test Structure
```typescript
import { describe, test, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('Module name', () => {
  test('should do something', () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
  });
});
```
