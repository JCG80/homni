## Testing Overview

### Current Test Coverage
- Unit tests for address lookup module
- Test suite for parseLead utility
- Validation tests for lead status transitions
- Authentication role handling tests

### Testing Priorities
1. More test coverage for lead distribution functions
2. Tests for service selection components
3. Authentication flow tests

## Future Development Roadmap

### Short-term (Next 2-4 weeks)
1. Complete the budget tracking system
2. Implement lead quality scoring
3. Add more detailed reporting for companies
4. Expand test coverage for critical modules
5. Extend parsing utilities to other entity types

### Mid-term (Next 2-3 months)
1. Implement AI-based lead matching algorithm (priority high)
2. Create mobile-responsive design for all pages
3. Add notification system for important events
4. Implement advanced filtering and search across the application
5. Add data export capabilities for reports

### Long-term
1. Implement AI-based lead matching
2. Create a mobile app for companies to manage leads on-the-go
3. Integrate with CRM systems
4. Implement a bidding system for leads
5. Create more advanced content management features like versioning and scheduling

## Best Practices and Patterns

### Type Safety Examples

#### Safe Lead Status Handling
```typescript
// Unsafe approach (don't do this)
const leads = apiData as Lead[]; // Might include invalid status values

// Safe approach (do this)
const leads = apiData.map(item => ({
  ...item,
  status: isValidLeadStatus(item.status) ? item.status : 'new',
})) as Lead[];
```

#### Safe Lead Parsing
```typescript
// Previously (unsafe approach - don't do this)
const leads = apiData as Lead[]; // Might cause TS2589 error

// Now (safe approach - do this)
import { parseLead } from '../utils/parseLead';
const leads = (apiData || []).map(parseLead);
```

### Authentication Best Practices

#### Role-Based Access Implementation
```typescript
// Define what modules each role can access
function getAllowedModulesForRole(role: UserRole): string[] {
  switch (role) {
    case 'guest':
      return ['home', 'leads/submit', 'info'];
    case 'member':
      return ['dashboard', 'leads'];
    // Other roles...
  }
}
```
