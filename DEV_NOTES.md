## Role System

### Standard User Roles

1. **Guest** (`guest`)
   - Unauthenticated visitors
   - Access to: home, login, register, public pages, lead submission
   - Redirected to login when attempting to access protected content

2. **User** (`user`)
   - Standard authenticated private users/homeowners
   - Access to: dashboard, profile, leads management, properties, maintenance, account settings
   - Can submit and track their own leads
   - Cannot access admin or company-specific features

3. **Company** (`company`)
   - Business users who can receive and manage leads
   - Access to: dashboard, profile, company settings, lead management, reports
   - Can configure their company profile and lead preferences
   - Receives leads based on their settings and distribution rules

4. **Admin** (`admin`)
   - System administrators with elevated privileges
   - Access to: all user and company features plus admin dashboard, content management, system settings
   - Can manage leads, users, and system configuration

5. **Master Admin** (`master_admin`)
   - Super users with unrestricted access
   - Access to: everything in the system
   - No restrictions on any module or feature

## Company Role Implementation

The company role has been implemented with these specific capabilities:

- Company users have access to their own leads, which are assigned to them by the system
- They can configure preferences for lead distribution through their settings
- Each company user is linked to a company profile, which stores additional company-specific information
- Company users can view reports related to their own leads
- They cannot access user-specific functionality like property management
- They cannot access admin functionality like content management

### Company Registration Process

1. When a user registers as a business:
   - A user account is created with role='company'
   - A company profile is created in the company_profiles table
   - The user's profile is updated with a reference to the company_id
   - The user is directed to their dashboard

### Company Access Control

- Routes specific to companies are protected with role-based guards
- The `canAccessModule` function defines what modules company users can access
- Company-specific UI components check for the company role before rendering
- Redirects are in place to prevent unauthorized access
