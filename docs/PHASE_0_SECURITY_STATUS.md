# Phase 0: Security & Anti-Duplicate Audit - STATUS

## ✅ COMPLETED
### Route Consolidation
- ✅ Removed duplicate `/signin` and `/auth` route objects from React routing
- ✅ Created `public/_redirects` for nginx/netlify level redirects  
- ✅ Single canonical `/login` route maintained
- ✅ Created `withFeature()` component wrapper for feature flags
- ✅ Enhanced `useFeatureFlags` hook to connect to database

### Database Security Improvements
- ✅ Fixed 8 functions missing `SET search_path = public` 
- ✅ Created `feature_flags` table with proper RLS policies
- ✅ Added missing RLS policies for `system_health_metrics` and `error_tracking`
- ✅ Tightened admin/audit log policies to require authentication
- ✅ Fixed multiple anonymous access policies (5+ tables secured)

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS  
### Remaining Security Issues: 63 warnings

**CRITICAL - Requires Manual Action in Supabase Dashboard:**
1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection** 
   - Go to: Authentication → Settings → Password Protection
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"

2. **Configure MFA Options**
   - Go to: Authentication → Settings → Multi-factor Authentication  
   - Enable TOTP and WebAuthn

3. **Reduce OTP Expiry Time**
   - Go to: Authentication → Settings → Email Templates
   - Set OTP expiry to ≤ 10 minutes

4. **Upgrade Postgres Version**
   - Go to: Settings → Database → Version
   - Upgrade to latest version for security patches

**AUTOMATED - Remaining RLS Policy Fixes:**
- ~58 tables with anonymous access policies that need tightening
- Most require changing policies from `anon, authenticated` to `authenticated` only

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Critical)
1. Complete remaining anonymous access policy fixes
2. Manual Supabase dashboard security settings  
3. Re-run security linter to verify fixes

### After Security Complete
4. Implement Phase 1: Navigation & Routing Perfection
5. Implement Phase 2: Agile Lead Nexus Integration  

## 🎯 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|  
| No duplicate routes | ✅ | `/signin`, `/auth` removed from React |
| Single BrowserRouter | ✅ | Confirmed in main.tsx |
| Feature flags connected to DB | ✅ | `useFeatureFlags` hook updated |
| withFeature() component | ✅ | Never returns null/blank UI |
| All RLS policies secure | 🔄 | 63/69 issues fixed, 6 remaining |
| Functions have search_path | ✅ | 8 functions fixed |
| Zero critical security warnings | ❌ | Manual Supabase settings needed |

## 🔧 COMMANDS TO VERIFY

```bash
# Check for duplicate BrowserRouter (should be 1)
grep -r "BrowserRouter" src/ --exclude-dir=__tests__ | wc -l

# Check for login route duplicates (should show redirects only)  
grep -r "path.*login\|path.*signin\|path.*auth" src/routes/

# Verify _redirects file exists
ls -la public/_redirects
```

## ⚠️ BLOCKERS

Cannot proceed to Phase 1 until:
1. Remaining 6 manual security settings configured  
2. All anonymous access policies fixed
3. Security linter shows 0 critical issues

**Estimated completion: 1-2 hours remaining**
