# Homni Platform Development Roadmap

*Last updated: 2025-01-09 - Phase 1B Complete*

## Project Vision

Homni is a comprehensive hybrid platform combining:
- **Lead Generation & Comparison** (Bytt.no style)
- **Property Documentation & Maintenance** (Boligmappa.no style)  
- **DIY Property Sales Flow** (Propr.no style)

Built as a modular, role-based, AI-ready platform with future pluggable real-estate listings.

## Current Status: Phase 1B Complete âœ…

- âœ… **Bulk Operations**: Mass module assignment and revocation capabilities
- âœ… **Role-Based Initialization**: Automatic module access based on user roles
- âœ… **Security Policies**: Complete RLS policies for all module access tables

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (100% Complete)
- âœ… **Database Migration**: Enum values standardized to slugs
- âœ… **Type System**: All TypeScript types use consistent slug values  
- âœ… **UI Layer**: Emoji/label mapping separated from business logic
- âœ… **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicates and consolidated imports
- âœ… **Role Standardization**: Updated all role references to use new system
- âœ… **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and standards created

## Next Phase: Documentation & Route Standardization

### Phase 2: Repository Standardization (In Progress)
- ðŸš§ **Documentation Scaffold**: Consolidate scattered docs into structured hierarchy
- ðŸ“‹ **Canonical Roles**: Make `user_profiles.role` authoritative source of truth
- ðŸ“‹ **Route Objects Standard**: Eliminate JSX `<Route>` elements, implement data-driven routing
- ðŸ“‹ **Distinct Dashboards**: Five unique role-based dashboard experiences
- ðŸ“‹ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive testing and quality gates
- ðŸ“‹ **Seed Infrastructure**: Idempotent test user seeding system

### Phase 3: Enhanced User Experiences (Planned)
- **Advanced Lead Management**: Sophisticated distribution strategies
- **Property Documentation**: Comprehensive maintenance tracking
- **AI Integration**: Smart lead matching and property insights
- **Mobile Optimization**: Progressive web app capabilities
- **Advanced Analytics**: Business intelligence dashboards

## Development Methodology

### Non-Negotiables
1. **Repository-wide development methodology**: All changes must follow established patterns
2. **Database security**: RLS policies enforced, all functions SECURITY DEFINER
3. **CI/CD gates**: No direct production deployments, all changes through PR review
4. **Code quality**: 90%+ test coverage, zero linting errors, TypeScript strict mode
5. **Documentation**: All modules documented, architectural decisions recorded

### Quality Standards
- **Build Status**: Must pass TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`)
- **Test Coverage**: Unit â‰¥90%, Integration â‰¥80%, E2E coverage for critical paths
- **Security**: All database tables protected by RLS, no high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: API p95 â‰¤200ms, DB queries p95 â‰¤100ms, bundle size â‰¤200KB gzipped
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## User Roles & Access Patterns

### Core Roles
- **`guest`**: Unauthenticated visitors (property search, basic info)
- **`user`**: Regular users (property management, lead submissions)
- **`company`**: Business users (lead intake, company management)
- **`content_editor`**: Content management (articles, pages, media)
- **`admin`**: System administration (users, companies, lead oversight - no lead acceptance)
- **`master_admin`**: Full system access (configuration, audit, role management)

### Role-Based Features
- **Lead Distribution**: Sophisticated algorithms based on company preferences, capacity, and performance
- **Module Access**: Granular control over feature availability per user/role
- **Company Management**: Multi-tenant architecture with company-specific settings
- **Content Management**: Versioned content with publication workflows
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Role-appropriate dashboards and insights

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), Testing Library (integration)
- **Build**: Vite with code splitting and lazy loading
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with comprehensive quality gates

### Key Modules
1. **Auth Module**: Role-based authentication with QuickLogin support
2. **Leads Module**: Lead management, processing, and distribution
3. **Content Module**: CMS for articles, pages, and marketing content
4. **User Module**: Profile management and company associations
5. **System Module**: Configuration, feature flags, and administration
6. **Feature Flags Module**: Runtime feature control and A/B testing

### Database Design Principles
- **RLS Security**: All tables protected by Row Level Security policies
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for sensitive operations
- **Migration Safety**: All schema changes include rollback scripts
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types from database schema
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes and query patterns
