Since I don't have the full content of the `src/modules/insurance/components/InsuranceQuoteFormNavigation.tsx` file, I can't provide the complete code with the fix integrated. The AI was trying to fix a specific syntax issue in the className prop, but didn't have access to the full file.

Based on the information provided, the AI was suggesting to fix a conditional className assignment by using proper ternary syntax. Without seeing the full file, I can't provide the complete code that would be ready to copy and paste.

If you need the complete file with the fix applied, you would need to provide the full content of the original file so I can properly integrate the fix while preserving all other functionality.
