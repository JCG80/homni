# Maintenance Module

<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Source=maintenance_tasks v1.0.0 (Do not edit by hand) -->

## Overview

The Maintenance Module provides a comprehensive seasonal property maintenance task management system for HOMNI platform users. This module enables property owners to track and complete maintenance tasks based on Norwegian seasons and property types.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Seasonal Task Scheduling**: Tasks are organized by Norwegian seasons (Vinter, Vår, Sommer, Høst)
- **Property Type Filtering**: Support for different property types (Leilighet, Enebolig, Rekkehus, etc.)
- **Task Completion Tracking**: Users can mark tasks as completed with optional notes
- **Due Date Management**: Tasks become due based on frequency and last completion date
- **Priority Levels**: Tasks are categorized as Høy, Middels, or Lav priority

### Admin Features
- **Task Management**: Admins can create, edit, and delete maintenance tasks
- **User Progress Monitoring**: View completion statistics across all users
- **Seasonal Task Overview**: Manage tasks by season and property type
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient management of multiple tasks

## Architecture

### Database Schema
- `maintenance_tasks`: Core task definitions with seasonal and property type associations
- `user_task_log`: User completion records with timestamps and notes
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own completion records

### API Layer
- `src/modules/maintenance/api/`: Core API functions for task management
- `listDueTasksForCurrentSeason()`: Get tasks due for current user and season
- `markCompleted()`: Record task completion with notes
- `getUserCompletions()`: Retrieve user's completion history

### Components
- `MaintenanceDashboard`: User-facing dashboard for viewing and completing tasks
- `MaintenanceAdmin`: Admin interface for task management
- `TaskCard`: Reusable component for displaying individual tasks
- `CompletionDialog`: Modal for recording task completion

## Feature Flags

The maintenance module is controlled by feature flags:
- `maintenance/dashboard`: Controls user dashboard access
- `maintenance/admin`: Controls admin interface access

## Internationalization

All user-facing strings support Norwegian localization through the i18n system:
- Task titles and descriptions
- Priority levels and status messages
- Seasonal categories
- Form labels and buttons

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to `/maintenance` to view maintenance dashboard
2. Tasks are automatically filtered by current season and user's property type
3. Click "Merk som fullført" to complete a task
4. Add optional completion notes
5. View completion history in the "Fullførte" tab

### For Admins
1. Access admin interface at `/admin/maintenance`
2. View all tasks and user completion statistics
3. Create new tasks with seasonal and property type associations
4. Edit existing tasks and manage priorities
5. Monitor user engagement and completion rates

## Development

### Adding New Tasks
```typescript
// Example task creation
const newTask = {
  title: 'Rengjøre takrenner',
  description: 'Fjern løv og annet rusk fra takrenner for å unngå vannskader',
  priority: 'Høy',
  frequency_months: 6,
  seasons: ['Høst', 'Vår'],
  property_types: ['Enebolig', 'Rekkehus']
};
```

### Testing
- Unit tests for all API functions
- Component tests for UI interactions
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Mock data available for development and testing

### Performance Considerations
- Tasks are filtered by season and property type to minimize data transfer
- Completion records use pagination for users with extensive history
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Push notifications for overdue tasks
- Task scheduling based on weather conditions
- Integration with home automation systems
- Photo uploads for completion verification
- Contractor recommendations for complex tasks

### API Extensions
- RESTful API endpoints for mobile app integration
- Webhook support for external system notifications
- Bulk import/export capabilities for task management

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- React Hook Form for form management
- Date-fns for date manipulation
- Lucide React for icons

### Development Dependencies
- Vitest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Faker.js for generating test data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No specific environment variables required - the module uses the standard HOMNI configuration.

### Feature Flag Configuration
```json
{
  "maintenance/dashboard": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rollout_percentage": 100,
    "target_roles": ["user", "company", "admin", "master_admin"]
  },
  "maintenance/admin": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rollout_percentage": 100,
    "target_roles": ["admin", "master_admin"]
  }
}
```

## Monitoring

### Metrics
- Task completion rates by season and property type
- User engagement levels
- Most frequently completed/skipped tasks
- Average time between task assignments and completion

### Alerts
- Low completion rates for critical tasks
- System errors in task retrieval or completion
- Unusual patterns in user behavior
