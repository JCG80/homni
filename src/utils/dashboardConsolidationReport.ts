 * ✅ Property integration widget
 * ✅ Quick actions hub
 * ✅ Recent activity display with lead status
 * ✅ Lazy loading for heavy components
 * ✅ Loading skeleton states

 * ✅ Lead attribution tracking
 * 
 * MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS:
 * - Reduced codebase by ~1000+ lines of duplicate code
 * - Single source of truth for user dashboard

 * - Simplified maintenance (only one file to update)
 * - Better TypeScript type safety with unified interfaces
 * 
 * COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS:
 * ✅ Follows Find-Before-Build protocol
 * ✅ Single source of truth principle
 * ✅ No duplicate interfaces or logic
 * ✅ Proper component naming conventions
 * ✅ Consistent import/export patterns
 * 
 * NEXT PHASE READY:
 * The dashboard is now consolidated and ready for further enhancements
 * without the risk of introducing duplicates.
