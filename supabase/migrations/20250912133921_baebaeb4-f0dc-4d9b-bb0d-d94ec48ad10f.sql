-- PHASE 0B: Fix Remaining Anonymous Access Security Issues
-- Tighten RLS policies to block anonymous access where inappropriate

-- 1. Fix tables that should NOT allow anonymous access
-- Most admin/sensitive tables should require authentication

-- Analytics and metrics tables - admin only, no anonymous
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all events" ON public.analytics_events;
CREATE POLICY "Only authenticated admins can view all events" ON public.analytics_events 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role) OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'master_admin'::app_role)));

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own events" ON public.analytics_events;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view their own events" ON public.analytics_events 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Fix company profiles to require authentication  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users view company profiles" ON public.company_profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Only authenticated users view company profiles" ON public.company_profiles 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND (
    user_id = auth.uid() 
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role) 
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'master_admin'::app_role)
  ));

-- Fix feature flags to be more restrictive  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can read feature flags" ON public.feature_flags;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view feature flags" ON public.feature_flags;
CREATE POLICY "Only authenticated users can read feature flags" ON public.feature_flags 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Fix user profiles to block anonymous completely
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Auth users view user profiles" ON public.user_profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Only authenticated admins view all user profiles" ON public.user_profiles 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND (
    id = auth.uid() 
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role) 
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'master_admin'::app_role)
  ));

-- Fix leads table to be more restrictive with anonymous access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Auth users view relevant leads" ON public.leads;
CREATE POLICY "Only authenticated users view relevant leads" ON public.leads 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND (
    submitted_by = auth.uid() 
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role) 
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'master_admin'::app_role) 
    OR has_role(auth.uid(), 'company'::app_role)
  ));

-- 2. Tables that can remain public (like detached_buildings) are OK
-- Keep these as they are intentionally public

-- 3. Fix storage policies to require authentication
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their property documents" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view their property documents" ON storage.objects 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND bucket_id = 'property-documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their property documents" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update their property documents" ON storage.objects 
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND bucket_id = 'property-documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their property documents" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete their property documents" ON storage.objects 
  FOR DELETE TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND bucket_id = 'property-documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- 4. Smart Start submissions - allow anonymous submissions but require auth for sensitive access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Companies view area submissions" ON public.smart_start_submissions;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated companies view area submissions" ON public.smart_start_submissions 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND has_role(auth.uid(), 'company'::app_role) AND lead_created = true AND postcode IS NOT NULL);

-- 5. System modules - tighten access 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can read system modules" ON public.system_modules;
CREATE POLICY "Only authenticated users can read system modules" ON public.system_modules 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND is_active = true);

-- 6. Enable proper Supabase Auth security settings
-- These will need to be done manually in Supabase dashboard but document them

-- Log security improvements
