## Type and Profile Standardization

The following issues have been fixed:

### 1. Profile Types
- Updated `Profile` interface to include all necessary fields from the database schema: id, full_name, role, company_id, created_at, metadata, email, phone, updated_at
- Added type for metadata as `Record<string, any>`
- Implemented proper extraction of company_id from both the direct field and metadata

### 2. UserRole Standardization
- Updated UserRole type to match project plan: 'guest' | 'member' | 'company' | 'admin' | 'master_admin' | 'provider' | 'editor'
- Changed references from 'user' to 'member' to match the project plan
- Added `isUserRole` type guard function for safe type checking

### 3. Type Safety
- Fixed type issues in RegisterForm.tsx with proper casting to UserRole
- Implemented type guard in ProtectedRoute.tsx
- Added safety checks in useAuth hook for role validation
- Updated CompanyLeadsPage.tsx to correctly extract company_id

### 4. Error Handling and Retry Logic
- Added useApiRetry hook for standardized API calls with retry logic
- Implemented proper error handling in profile operations
- Added toast notifications for user feedback

### 5. Code Duplication
- Consolidated role checking logic
- Standardized type usage across components
- Removed redundant type definitions

## Verification

The code now correctly handles:
- Profile data from database including metadata
- UserRole validation and type safety
- Company ID extraction from both direct fields and metadata
- Proper error handling and retry logic for API calls

All TypeScript errors related to these issues have been resolved.
