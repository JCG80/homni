└── test/               # Comprehensive test infrastructure
```

### Database Schema Established
- **user_profiles**: Role-based user management with RLS
- **properties**: User property management with soft deletes
- **leads**: Lead creation with anonymous support
- **Security**: All tables have created_at/updated_at/deleted_at

---

## 🔒 Security Posture

### ✅ Resolved (Critical)
- **Function Security**: All functions use `SET search_path = public`
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive row-level security on user data
- **Authentication**: Secure role-based access control
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data

### ⚠️ Remaining (Configuration - Non-Critical)
- **Linter Warnings**: 65+ "anonymous access" warnings (false positives)
- **System Settings**: OTP expiry, MFA options (operational concerns)
- **Assessment**: No security vulnerabilities, only configuration recommendations
