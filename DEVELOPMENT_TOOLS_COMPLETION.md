- **Recommended Extensions**: `.vscode/extensions.json`
- **Debug Utilities**: `scripts/dev-debug.ts`

## üìã Manual Tasks Required

### Package.json Script Updates

Since `package.json` is read-only, these scripts need to be added manually:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // Performance & Monitoring
    "perf:monitor": "tsx scripts/performance-monitor.ts",
    "perf:test": "tsx scripts/performance-monitor.ts test",
    "perf:bundle": "tsx scripts/performance-monitor.ts bundle",
    
    // Advanced Development
    "seed:advanced": "tsx scripts/db-seed-advanced.ts",
    "seed:reset": "tsx scripts/db-seed-advanced.ts --reset",
    "deploy:check": "tsx scripts/deployment-check.ts",
    
    // Debug Utilities (from previous implementation)
    "dev:debug": "tsx scripts/dev-debug.ts",
    "debug:auth": "tsx scripts/dev-debug.ts auth",
    "debug:db": "tsx scripts/dev-debug.ts db",
    "debug:all": "tsx scripts/dev-debug.ts all"
  }
}
```
