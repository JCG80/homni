# Code Audit Report

## 1. Build and Test Status

### Build Status
✅ Fixed syntax error in InsuranceQuoteFormNavigation.tsx
- Line 64-65 had missing bracket closure causing TS1005 and TS1381 errors

### Test Status
- Tests status pending full execution

## 2. Project Structure Analysis

### Module Existence Check
| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Auth | ✅ Present | Implements login, registration, role management |
| Leads | ✅ Present | Lead capture and management system |
| Insurance | ✅ Present | Insurance quote and comparison systems |
| Content | ✅ Present | Content management system |
| Property | ✅ Present | Property management functionality |
| Services | ✅ Present | Service selection and management |
| Docs | ✅ Present | Documentation module |

### Route Consistency
❌ **Issue**: Multiple route definitions in both `Routes.tsx` and `App.tsx`
💡 **Recommendation**: Consolidate routing into a single routing definition file using React Router's Outlet pattern

## 3. Duplication and Consistency Issues

### Authentication and User Profiles
❌ **Issue**: Two different implementations of `useAuthState` hook 
- `src/modules/auth/hooks/useAuthState.ts`
- `src/modules/auth/hooks/useAuthState.tsx` 
💡 **Recommendation**: Merge these into a single implementation with consistent return type

❌ **Issue**: Multiple role utility files with overlapping functionality
- `src/modules/auth/utils/roles.ts`
- `src/modules/auth/utils/roleUtils.ts`
💡 **Recommendation**: Consolidate into a single roles utility file

### Type Definitions
❌ **Issue**: `UserRole` type defined in multiple locations
- `src/modules/auth/types/types.ts`
- `src/modules/auth/utils/roles.ts`
💡 **Recommendation**: Create a single source of truth for UserRole type

### API Services
❌ **Issue**: Detached Buildings API functionality split between files
- `src/modules/insurance/api/insuranceApi.ts`
- `src/modules/insurance/api/detachedBuildingsApi.ts`
💡 **Recommendation**: Consolidate related API functionality in appropriate modules

## 4. Database Schema Analysis

### Tables Schema Review
✅ `detached_buildings` table properly created with necessary columns and timestamps
✅ Row-level security appears to be properly implemented on most tables

### RLS Policy Review
❌ **Issue**: Some tables may be missing Row Level Security policies
💡 **Recommendation**: Review all tables and ensure appropriate RLS policies are in place

## 5. Type Safety Issues

### DetachedBuilding Type
✅ Fixed: Added missing timestamp fields to DetachedBuilding interface in `detached-buildings-types.ts`

## 6. Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. API Layer Consistency
- Implement a consistent pattern for API calls across modules
- Consider using custom hooks for data fetching that leverage React Query consistently

### 2. Authentication Flow Enhancement
- Consolidate auth state management into a single, well-tested implementation
- Create clear documentation for role-based permissions system

### 3. Component Organization
- Consider breaking large components into smaller, focused components
- Implement a consistent pattern for form handling across the application

### 4. Database Schema Optimization
- Ensure consistent naming conventions across tables
- Review foreign key relationships for integrity

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Implement proper data caching strategies with React Query
- Review component re-rendering patterns to minimize unnecessary updates

## Next Steps
1. Address the duplicate hook implementations in the auth module
2. Consolidate routing configuration in a single location
3. Complete a thorough review of Row Level Security policies
4. Standardize API calling patterns across modules
